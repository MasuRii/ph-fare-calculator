**PH Fare Estimator** is a cross-platform mobile application designed to help tourists, expats, and locals estimate public transport costs across the Philippines.

Unlike city-centric navigation apps, this tool focuses on **"How much?"** rather than "How to?". It solves the complex problem of Philippine geography by combining distance-based formulas (for roads) with static fare matrices (for trains and ferries).

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Nationwide Coverage:** Works in Metro Manila, Cebu, Davao, and rural provinces.
- **Hybrid Calculation Engine:**
  - **Dynamic:** Uses OSRM to calculate road distance for Jeeps, Taxis, and Buses.
  - **Static:** Uses Lookup Tables for fixed-price modes like MRT/LRT and Ferries.
- **Scam Detector:** Provides a "Fair Price Range" vs. "Overpriced" indicator to help tourists avoid getting ripped off.
- **Multi-Mode Comparison:** Compare the cost of a **Yellow Airport Taxi** (Premium) vs. a **White Taxi** (Regular) vs. **Jeepney** (Budget).
- **Offline Reference:** View saved routes and static fare cheat sheets without an internet connection.
- **Smart Search:** Disambiguates inputs (e.g., *San Jose, Antique* vs. *San Jose, Nueva Ecija*).

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Flutter (v3.16+) & Dart
- **Backend & Remote Config:** Firebase (Remote Config & Analytics)
- **Routing & Geocoding:** OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine) and a custom geocoding service implementation.
- **Local Storage:** `shared_preferences` for caching user settings and favorites.
- **HTTP Client:** `http` package for network requests.

## 🧮 How It Works (The Hybrid Engine)

The Philippines has a fragmented transport pricing system. This app handles it using two methods:

### 1. Formula-Based (Road)
Used for **Jeepneys, Buses, Taxis, UV Express**.
> `Fare = Base Fare + ((OSRM Distance * 1.15) * Per KM Rate)`

*   **Why 1.15?** Public transport routes are rarely as direct as private car routes. We add a 15% variance factor to OSRM's output to approximate real-world travel.
*   **Provincial Variance:** A 20% variance is applied to the total fare when the "Provincial" toggle is enabled.

### 2. Matrix-Based (Fixed)
Used for **MRT, LRT, PNR, and Ferries**.
Distance formulas fail here (e.g., Rail distance ≠ Road distance).
> `Fare = Database lookup [Origin_Station] -> [Dest_Station]`

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ph-fare-estimator.git
    cd ph-fare-estimator
    ```

2.  **Set up Firebase**
    This project uses Firebase for remote configuration and analytics. You must set up a Firebase project and place the appropriate configuration file in the project directory:
    - For Android: `android/app/google-services.json`
    - For iOS: `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist`
    The app will not build without these files.

3.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

4.  **Configure API (Optional)**
    By default, the app uses the public OSRM demo server. For production or heavy testing, update `lib/src/services/routing/osrm_routing_service.dart` with your own server URL.

5.  **Run the App**
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```
