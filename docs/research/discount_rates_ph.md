# Research Report: Philippine Transportation Discount Rates (2024-2025)

## Executive Summary
All major public transportation modes in the Philippines (Jeepneys, Buses, Trains, UV Express, Taxis/TNVS) are legally mandated to provide a **20% fare discount** to Students, Senior Citizens, and Persons with Disabilities (PWDs). This discount applies to the regular base fare and succeeding kilometers. Recent 2024 updates from the LTFRB reiterate strict compliance for TNVS (e.g., Grab) and PUVs, emphasizing that the discount is valid on weekends and holidays for students.

## 2. Mode-Specific Implementation Guidelines

### Jeepneys (Traditional & Modern)
*   **Discount Application:** 20% off the total fare (Base Fare + Distance).
*   **Rounding:** Fare is often rounded down to the nearest centavo or peso depending on exact fare matrix, but the 20% calculation is the standard.
*   **Note:** Drivers must honor the discount even on weekends/holidays for students.

### Buses (City & Provincial)
*   **Discount Application:** 20% off the total ticket price.
*   **Reservation:** For provincial buses, advance booking usually requires presenting ID to apply the discount at the ticketing booth or online (if supported).

### Trains (LRT-1, LRT-2, MRT-3, PNR)
*   **Discount Application:** 20% off the single-journey ticket price.
*   **Stored Value Cards (Beep Cards):** Concessionary Beep cards are available for Seniors/PWDs/Students which automatically deduct the discounted fare.
*   **Manual Entry:** Passengers without concessionary cards must queue at the teller to avail of the discount for single-journey tickets.

### UV Express
*   **Discount Application:** 20% off the fixed point-to-point fare or distance-based fare.
*   **Enforcement:** Strictly monitored; refusal to grant discount is a franchise violation.

### Taxis and TNVS (Transport Network Vehicle Services)
*   **Discount Application:** 20% off the **total fare**.
*   **TNVS (e.g., Grab, JoyRide):**
    *   Most apps have a dedicated option or profile setting to apply the discount automatically upon booking (requires ID verification).
    *   If not applied in-app, the driver *should* deduct 20% from the final fare upon presentation of ID, though this often causes friction.
*   **Recent Updates (late 2024):** The LTFRB has issued stern warnings to TNVS operators to strictly comply with the discount law. There is an ongoing regulatory discussion regarding whether the Platform (TNC) or the Driver shoulders the cost, but the **passenger's right to the 20% discount is absolute**.
